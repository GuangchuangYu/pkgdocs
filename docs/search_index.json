The plot produced by the function will be used as the canvas, and we can apply theme and add layers to it: library(dplyr) d &lt;- group_by(mtcars, cyl) %&gt;% summarize(xm=mean(mpg), ym=mean(disp)) pp &lt;- as.bbplot(f) + bb_theme_expand() + bb_theme_grey() + bb_lm(bb_aes(mpg, disp, group=cyl, col=factor(cyl)), data=mtcars, lwd=2, lty=&#39;dashed&#39;) + bb_point(bb_aes(xm, ym, col=factor(cyl)), data=d, pch=19, cex=2) + bb_title(&quot;hello plotbb&quot;) + bb_grid(col=&#39;grey30&#39;, lty=&#39;dashed&#39;) ## grid lines were plotted as background by default As there are many features currently not available, plotbb supports adding layers using base graphics commands that you are already familiar with. Any base graphics commands in formula, expression or function can be served as layer to be added to a bbplot object. pp + (~points(30, 400, pch=19, col=&quot;red&quot;, cex=3)) + ~text(30, 420, label=&quot;hae fun :)&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;, cex=1.2) "]
